# php_form_registration  

My first application in php to register users. The goal is to integrate all my javascript mini projects inside a big crud application.

## To do  

- [ ] Add a forgot password ðŸ”‘
- [x] a nice animation to the welcome message ðŸ‘‹ when logging or registering. It needs to be multicolor and chars will display one after the other
- [ ] a navbar (if possible) on the home page (the tools will be classified by category : game ðŸŽ®, weather app â˜€, calculator ðŸ–©, to do-list, and so on)
- [x] All the games and utilities as ~~flex~~ grid ðŸ’ª elements (and their behavior should be responsive) (Here improvements are coming )
- [ ] a different page for each tool
- [ ] the background image may change depending of the moment of the day : sunrise ðŸŒ…, day â˜€, sunset ðŸŒ‡, night ðŸŒ™
- [ ] The counter of visits will be attached to an other element (possibly the navbar, and so it will no more be so messy positionned)
- [ ] I should think to make the footer ðŸ¦¶ mobile (animation ðŸŽž)
- [ ] display the time in the navbar, eventually
- [ ] the to-do-list must use the LocalStorage
- [x] For the log out, a dialog ðŸ’¬ should pop up ( maybe a blur effect will be interesting, in background )
- [ ] The navbar should contain profile with infos about user, tools ( in many sections ) and logout

This list will be updated depending on my progression through it.
