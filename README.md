# php_form_registration  

My first application in php to register users. The goal is to integrate all my javascript mini projects inside a big crud application.

## To do  

- [ ] Add a forgot password ðŸ”‘
- [ ] Inside the forgot password, I will ask your email address and send a random number with 6 digits (so between 100000 and 999999)
- [ ] The user will enter that number and will pass only if the number matches. After that the number will be put to zero in the DB.
- [ ] For the registration, I will do the same thing.
- [x] a nice animation to the welcome message ðŸ‘‹ when logging or registering. It needs to be multicolor and chars will display one after the other
- [x] a navbar (if possible) on the home page
- [ ] ~~the tools will be classified by category : game ðŸŽ®, weather app â˜€, calculator ðŸ–©, to do-list, and so on~~
- [x] All the games and utilities as ~~flex~~ grid ðŸ’ª elements (and their behavior should be responsive) (Here improvements are coming )
- [ ] a different page for each tool
- [ ] ~~the background image may change depending of the moment of the day : sunrise ðŸŒ…, day â˜€, sunset ðŸŒ‡, night ðŸŒ™~~ (*canceled*)
- [ ] ~~The counter of visits will be attached to an other element (possibly the navbar, and so it will no more be so messy positionned)~~
- [ ] I should think to make the footer ðŸ¦¶ mobile (animation ðŸŽž)
- [ ]  ~~display the time in the navbar, eventually~~
- [x]  The time will now appear in the Profile tab.
- [ ] the to-do-list must use the LocalStorage
- [x] For the log out, a dialog ðŸ’¬ should pop up ( maybe a blur effect will be interesting, in background )
- [x] The navbar should contain profile with infos about user, tools ( in many sections ) and logout
- [x] The infos like counter of visits will be in Profile
- [x] The "go back to top" button may be set as fixed element, so it will display at the bottom of the page as soon as we quit the top  
- [x] If we click on the DOM elements that have the notification **ping**, it disappears and for the *Profile* sections, a dialog ðŸ’¬ will open and display infos about the users  
- [x] If the user has alredy checked the one of the ping elements(especially the logout elements for the small and large screens navbars), if he reduce or increase the size of his screen and so, for example the display for small or large sreens occurs, the ping **WILL NO LONGER BE PRESENT**  
- [x] Added the simple calculator file  
- [x] Add Typescript instead of vanilla JavaScript for the calculator
- [x] Add Typescript instead of vanilla JavaScript for the home page
- [x] Correct all the errors for the home.ts page
- [x] Now the next mission is to add ts for the login page
- [x] And correct all the (**potential**)  errors;
- [x] And after that the register page
- [x] And there too, fix every single squiggled line 
  
This list will be updated depending on my progression through it.
